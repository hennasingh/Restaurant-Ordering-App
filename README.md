# Restaurant Ordering App (Mobile)

## Overview

This project was built while learning essential Javascript concepts (Arrays, Objects, etc)  in Scrimba's Frontend Career Path course. The project uses pre-populated data.js to render menu items on the screen for a user to select. The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### Solo Project Challenge

####  Requirements

- Follow the design spec.
- Render the menu options using JavaScript.
- Be able to add/remove items.
- Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs.

#### Stretch Goals
- Change the theme.
- Offer a "meal-deal" discount.
- Allow users to rate their ordering experience.

### Tech Stack

  - HTML5

  - Vanilla JS
 
### Learnings

This was a great project to get hands-on experience working with JavaScript Objects, Arrays and Functions. A hands on experience with DOM manipulation. It was a tricky logic to track removal of items from the menu while adding new ones. It was overall a fun project to work with.

### Acknowledgments

Much Gratitude to Scrimba Mentors and Code Reviewers for their guidance on this project and Frontend Development Path in general.
